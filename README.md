# workGPT
workGPT is use your workflow to work. using chatGPT-3/4

I am creating a work GPT software project (GPT means AI large language model, AI large language model, trained through massive text content, can reply according to user prompts). The work GPT software (it) can be trained through the content I have read before, the accumulated knowledge, as well as sharing and links. At the same time, I will conduct intensive training based on my daily work methods, business processes, and comments generated based on shared articles. After the first phase of its training was completed, I worked with it for a period of time and let it perform intensive learning. During this period, it automatically adjusted and learned based on the work content and my evaluation and mutual communication.
Eventually it can replicate my work style, basic abilities and methods. I can create different jobs and let them automatically handle some complex matters according to tasks and styles, create software projects, modify codes, receive customers, generate product copy, organize, Manage meetings and speak at meetings.

This Project is both python and web host.

We may build web host first,based on https://ai.zyinfo.pro .
